# EE225E-Project

Course Project for [EE225E - Principles of Magnetic Resonance Imaging](http://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~ee225e/sp16/)
at UC Berkeley. 

In this project we explore whether enforcing spatial regularity can help to overcome low SNR in metabolism maps generated in hyperpolarized carbon-13 MRI experiments.
